## 세나풀 (Senapul)

### 📱Description
***Mobile app for managing gardening logs (9th conference of TAVE winning project)***

Recently, as external activities have decreased due to COVID-19, interest in pets and pet plants has increased. 
However, it was difficult to raise plants because they has different water cycles and care precautions depending on the plant type.

Senapul remembers the watering cycle for each plant and sends a notification to user when to water the plant. 
It also developed to help plant keepers with the ability to write and manage plant diaries and share them with other users.
